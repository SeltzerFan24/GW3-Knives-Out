			<h2>Set Design</h2>

			<p>To ensure that Knives Out is an immersive experience, Writer/Director Rian Johnson and Producer Ram Bergman wisely relied on Production Designer David Crank, Set Decorator David Schlesinger SDSA and their teams, setting the bar at high-level creativity...and fun!</p>

							<div><span>Harlan’s office, desktop... We’ve come full circle in this set and find equally fascinating objects...the automaton arm, the armature with pairs of gloved hands, the bronze bee, artifacts permanently sealed in glass, and a vintage baseball that becomes a prop throughout the film.</span></div>

							<div><span>Harlan’s private study... “A lot happens in this small room, and blocking played a big part of how we dressed it. The script called for a white leather day bed, which I had fabricated. I found a terrific day bed, with carved little heads on it, and we adjusted it to fit into the set..”</span></div>

							<div><span>Thrombey library, the Wheel of Knives... “Director Rian Johnson and DP Steve Yedlin specifically wanted something that would not be solid, so light would come through,” reveals Set Decorator David Schlesinger SDSA. “Rian wanted a sense of movement in the knives, as if they were all being thrown toward the center...”</span></div>

							<div><span>"It was a challenging set of problems. We created several prototypes, but nothing was really hitting the mark with Rian. Eventually we came up with building an armature to hold the knives and hanging it off of chain from the balcony. Rebecca Greene was really responsible for making it all happen and was able to find a preexisting metal circle. My only real instruction to her was “treat it like sculpture”, which she did. The end result was beautiful, and of course it has a huge part on the movie."</span></div>

							<div><span>The Thrombey estate consisted of two separate locations and a built set. We spent weeks shooting in each of the locations. Each of these spaces had unique challenges. The Living Room, Sitting Room with the Stash Clock, Exteriors, and Harlan’s Office were shot in a private home that had many truly priceless items in it. That was a monumental task for Shann and his team.</span></div>

I gathered up a selection of Key Objects, and Rian created book titles to coordinate with each one. The Art Department created the hero books, along with two titles for every year Harlan had been writing...”</span></div>

							<div><span>Harlan’s office... David imparts, “I was hesitant to use magic posters, as they are so often reproduced, but when I stumbled upon a collection of original posters, I could not refuse. The themes of controlling humans through mystical means was icing on the cake. Puppets and Automatons are also a reoccurring theme in the dressing of KNIVES OUT. We were fortunate to use the work of artist Tom Haney, who creates contemporary mechanical figures...” </span></div>

							<div><span>Harlan’s private study... “Harlan Thrombey's private study, was a built set. A few challenges here… We had another set, Harlan’s Office, on the main floor of the house. It was important to make these spaces feel unique and existing for separate purposes. The upstairs study is where he writes. It is Harlan’s private space.”</span></div>
